This project is created in pure JavaScript, keeping functionality and logic in focus over UI design. The application has a secure registration and login system where users can register, build profiles with names and profile pictures, and use the application.

The project has four main components:

Business Management (ARP Software): Users can manage their business by adding products, generating invoices, and organizing categories.
Contact Management: A dedicated section for storing business contacts, allowing users to save, edit, and delete contact numbers easily.
Custom Video Player: A JavaScript-based custom video player that enables users to select and play videos without hassle.
About & Contact: Provides basic information and a contact page for user convenience.
Note: This project is focused on developing functionality and logic, with a minimalist and simple UI.
